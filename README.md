MAXWELL game engine v0.1 - ImGui docking

This project aims to create a basic game engine using openGL.
Following along The Cherno's Game Engine series, this engine is being built from scratch.
Once the engine is fully functional and I understand the aspects of creating a custom game engine, I plan to rewrite it from scratch using a lower-level graphics API (Vulkan) and make it my own.
