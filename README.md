MAXWELL game engine v0.1 - ImGui docking

This project aims to create a basic game engine using openGL.
As of today this engine is being built from scratch following along The Cherno's Game Engine series.
Once the engine will be fully functional and I understand the aspects of a creating a custom game engine, I plan on re-writing the engine from scratch as to make it my own and implement additionnal features such as Vulkan rendering.
